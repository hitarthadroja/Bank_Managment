# Bank_Managment

📌 Project Description

This project is a C++ console-based Bank Management System designed to simulate basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows secure login, account creation, transactions, and loan management in an interactive, menu-driven environment.

The application demonstrates real-world banking workflows such as account validation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and loan processing, making it suitable for academic projects and OOP practice.
